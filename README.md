# RPG Game

A JavaScript-based Role Playing Game, that through modules and themes makes the program flexible to support various themes.

Through this project, I practiced ES6 `Class` syntax and employed the MVC pattern in order to separate concerns.

## Usage

Clone repo: git clone https://github.com/alightedlamp/RPG-Game

Install dependencies: `npm install`

Run server: `gulp`

## Customize

To customize this app to make the RGP game your own, update the `playerData` module in `/js` with your own characters, and the `theme` module with your own background, title, and description.
